No seriously, I feel like half the time we’re just being, I have an ear to ear grin and I want to hug and squeeze you and go grocery shopping. But today, we’re dancing along to a Taekwondo song, galavanting through a hike, with the nature around us all etched stone. We’re racing around and exploring what we can see, being as loud as we are until we remember to be quiet.">

No seriously, I feel like half the time we’re just being, I have an ear to ear grin and I want to hug and squeeze you and go grocery shopping. But today, we’re dancing along to a Taekwondo song, galavanting through a hike, with the nature around us all etched stone. We’re racing around and exploring what we can see, being as loud as we are until we remember to be quiet. Howe can time be continuous, moving forward at the same pace all the time when every time we do something new, the smallest moment lasts forever, and the longest day disappears in a flash?  On this short stone hike, I’m feeling in love with you.</p>
